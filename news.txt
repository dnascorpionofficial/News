XENTHERA VANTA X6 CHANGELOGS
---

October 31 - 2025
Version Code : 112
• Fixed the issue of fetching data from Github with bypassing IP ✔️
• Changed the scheduling policy of main script to idle mode ✔️
• Added custom url for different ROM to reduce network traffic ✔️
• Auto reset to OFF Battery saving after enable Restart Injector / Reboot device✔️
• Switched legacy commands to Brutal BusyBox equivalents for robust, Advanced control ✔️

"What was the issue?"
'So we use curl & wget commands for fetching data from my Github, The wget getting bad address error in BusyBox stems from DNS resolution failure, where its lightweight wget can't convert the domain to an IP. misconfigured /etc/resolv.conf (no nameservers like 8.8.8.8), blocked DNS traffic'

'In old updates, added 3 methods to check it, one is curl but some ROM don't have curl support by default, our busybox also don't have so the second one is normal wget, that also no idea that which ROM have it by default. Then the last one is busybox wget for fetching data,at this point the issue here is network walls / some other reason blocks the commands of unauthorised access for shell files sometimes . Then we can't get the data because of blocking, that's why the module failure happens with fetching IMEI / EXPIRY DATE'

I'm working on implementing a novel bypass technique to address this connectivity issue. The approach involves using the nslookup command with Google DNS (8.8.8.8) to retrieve the four most recent IP addresses associated with GitHub, then fetching data via those valid IP address. Progress going on.. well this will be the Version Code 112 major update.

• Fixed few errors ✔️
"What's the issue?"
So currently the module fetches the expiry date + IMEI from my Github account & if it's valid then module will start working but the major issue here is if the module failed to fetch from my Github account then it will produce empty value & module will end with errors.
